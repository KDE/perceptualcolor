# Contribution to PerceptualColor

This project uses CI to perform some checks on merge requests. You can also run locally most of these checks with

```shell
scripts/local-ci-fast.sh
scripts/local-ci-build-warnings.sh
```

and with

```shell
scripts/automatic-integration.sh
```

you can do some adjustments automatically.
