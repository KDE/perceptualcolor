/** @brief A perceptually uniform color picker dialog
 *
 * The color dialog’s function is to allow users to choose colors intuitively.
 * For example, you might use this in a drawing program to allow the user to
 * set the brush color.
 *
 * At difference to QColorDialog, this
 * dialog’s graphical components are perceptually uniform and therefore more
 * intuitive. It’s internally based on the LCH color model, which does reflect
 * the human perception much better than RGB or its transforms like HSV. At
 * the same time, this dialog does not require the user itself to know
 * anything about LCH at all, because the graphical representations is
 * intuitive.
 *
 * @image html ColorDialog.png "ColorDialog" width=500
 * @image html ColorDialogTab1.png "ColorDialog" width=500
 * @image html ColorDialogTab2.png "ColorDialog" width=500
 *
 * It is an @ref qdialogsourceompatibility "mostly source-compatible"
 * replacement for QColorDialog. It also adds some extra functionality
 * that is not available in QColorDialog.
 *
 * Just as with QColorDialog, the static functions provide a modal color
 * dialog. The static getColor() function shows the dialog, and allows
 * the user to specify a color:
 *d
 * @snippet testcolordialog.cpp ColorDialog Get color
 *
 * The function can also be used to let
 * users choose a color with a level of transparency: pass the alpha channel
 * option as an additional argument:
 *
 * @snippet testcolordialog.cpp ColorDialog Get color with alpha channel
 *
 * @image html ColorDialogAlpha.png "ColorDialog with alpha channel" width=500
 *
 * More features:
 *
 * - A screen color picker is provided on many platforms.
 *
 * - For a non-modal dialog, use the normal constructors of this class.
 *
 * - The default window title is <em>Select Color</em>, and not the title of
 * your application. It can of course be customized with
 * <tt>QWidget::setWindowTitle()</tt>. The window title will
 * <em>not</em> be updated on <tt>QEvent::LanguageChange</tt> events.
 *
 * - At difference to the usual native platform color dialog, <em>this</em>
 * dialog can be resized. That makes sense, because it allows to see better
 * the gamut image. Therefore, this dialog is by default bigger than the usual
 * native platform color dialog. You can of course customize the dialog
 * size with QWidget::resize() or force a more space-saving layout through
 * the @ref layoutDimensions property.
 *
 * - The @ref ColorPatch that indicates the selected color is placed prominently
 * at the top of the widget. That is also useful for touch screens as the
 * @ref ColorPatch will not be hidden by the hand of the user when the user
 * is touching the above color selection widgets.
 *
 * - This dialog uses icons. See @ref hidpisupport "High DPI support"
 * about how to enable support for high-DPI icons.
 *
 * @note @anchor qdialogsourceompatibility The API of this class is mostly
 * source-compatible to the API of QColorDialog. This is a list of
 * incompatibilities:
 * - The constructors and also @ref getColor() require a color space
 *   as argument.
 * - As this dialog does not provide functionality for custom colors and
 *   standard color, the corresponding static functions of QColorDialog are
 *   not available in this class.
 * - The option <tt>ColorDialogOption::DontUseNativeDialog</tt>
 *   will always remain <tt>false</tt> (even if set explicitly), because it’s
 *   just the point of this library to provide an own, non-native dialog.
 * - While the enum declaration @ref ColorDialogOption itself is aliased
 *   here, this isn't possible for the enum values itself. Therefor, when
 *   working with @ref options, you cannot use <tt>ShowAlphaChannel</tt> but
 *   you have to use the fully qualified identifier (either
 *   <tt>PerceptualColor::ColorDialog::ColorDialogOption::ShowAlphaChannel</tt>
 *   or <tt>QColorDialog::ShowAlphaChannel</tt>, at your option.
 * - Calling @ref setCurrentColor() with colors that
 *   are <em>not</em> <tt>QColor::Spec::Rgb</tt> will lead to an automatic
 *   conversion like QColorDialog does, but at difference to QColorDialog, it
 *   is done with more precision, therefor the resulting
 *   @ref currentColor() might be slightly different. The same is true
 *   for <tt>QColor::Spec::Rgb</tt> types with floating point precision:
 *   While QColorDialog would round to full integers, <em>this</em> dialog
 *   preserves the floating point precision.
 * - When the default constructor is used, unlike QColorDialog, the default
 *   color is <em>not</em> guaranteed to be <tt>Qt::white</tt>.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * @note In the QColorDialog API, the function <tt>QColorDialog::getRgba()</tt>
 * has been deprecated during the Qt5 life cycle. This class does not provide
 * source compatibility with obsolete functions of the QColorDialog API.
 *
 * @todo The @ref ColorDialogPrivate::m_lchLightnessSelector has a different
 * scale than the @ref ColorDialogPrivate::m_chromaHueDiagram, but both are
 * directly side-by-side in the dialog. Would it make sense to use the
 * same scale for both?
 *
 * @todo Provide an option to enable labels for the
 * <a href="https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color12.html">warm-cool</a>
 * contrast, maybe outside the wheel around the position 45° (warm) and
 * 135° (cool).
 *
 * @todo In web design, CSS4 is often used. CSS4 also supports the
 * <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#the-hsl-notation"> HSL</a> and
 * the  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#the-hwb-notation">HBW</a>
 * color space. We should do the same.
 *
 * @todo Provide <tt>setResizable(bool resizable)</tt>. Do not provide
 * a property, because in the background this is setting <em>two</em>
 * different values, which might be conflicting in the moment when read
 * access is done. Code within ColorDialog to enable:
 * <tt><br/>
 *  layout()->setSizeConstraint(QLayout::SetFixedSize);
 * <br/>
 *  setSizeGripEnabled(false);
 * <br/></tt>
 * Document the performance impact: When resizing is allowed (which is the
 * default), the user can make the window very big, which might increase
 * the rendering time considerable.
 *
 * @todo Use <tt>QSignalBlocker</tt> instead of m_updateIsRunning in
 * ColorDialog. Attention: The connection alpha-slider and alpha-spinbox
 * is special and would not work anymore, which has to be fixed.
 *
 * @todo In KDE’s systemsettings, in the “Fonts” settings, there are small
 * buttons showing a “i” symbol (for “information”) that has no functionality,
 * but a tooltip for the widget at the left. Would this be also good for
 * @ref ColorDialog?
 *
 * @todo Recently KDE merged something that displays tooltips and integrates a
 * link that calls the <tt>QWhatsThis</tt> which has more information. Would
 * this be helpful here also?
 *
 * @todo Since August 2021 <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/T9460">the
 * Breeze styling of spin boxes has changed</a>. Is or should be the
 * new default horizontal alignment “center”?
 *
 * @todo Make sure that @ref ChromaHueDiagram always shows at least at the
 * central physical pixel with an in-gamut color. Solution: Limit the range
 * of the lightness selector? Or a better algorithm in @ref ChromaHueDiagram?
 *
 * @todo Provide (on demand) two patches, like Scribus also does: One for the
 * old color (cannot be modified by the user) and another one for the new
 * color (same behavior as the yet existing color patch). One could be
 * named “before” and the other “after”. Or maybe make this configurable?
 * And put an arrow between the patches, from “before” to “after”. (Be aware:
 * RTL support necessary!)
 *
 * @section uireview Review of the user interface
 *
 * @todo The HLC widget accepts values that are out-of-gamut; the dialog
 * shows the nearest in-gamut color during this moment. Also, the RGB Hex
 * widget accepts intermediatly invalid values (for example, 4-digit-values);
 * the dialog displays the last previously displayed valid color during
 * this moment. Those two situations do not have consiteend behaviour,
 * but there are no good alternatives. However: Would it make sense to
 * keep this behaviour, but display in the @ref ColorPatch an empty
 * value during editing an out-of-gamut HLC value or an invalid RGB Hex values?
 *
 * @todo For the tab widget, use rather icons instead of the text “hue-baded”
 * and “lightness-based”!?
 *
 * @todo Provide more <tt>tooltip()</tt> help for widgets. For
 * @ref WheelColorPicker and @ref ChromaLightnessDiagram, this
 * help text could describe the keyboard controls and be integrated
 * as default value in the class itself. For the other widgets, a
 * help text could be defined here within <em>this</em> class,
 * if appropriate.
 *
 * @todo Touch screen compatibility: In general: What would mean better
 * support for touch-screen and convertible? More things to do? For example,
 * A spin box can also be used on mobile phone (putting the numbers
 * with on-screen keyboard). But the + and - button for increasing
 * or decreasing the values might be too small. And mobile UI uses
 * often wheels for this use case…
 *
 * @section additionalcolordialogfeatures Proposals for additional features
 *
 * @todo The QLineEdit for the hexadecimal RGB values should change lower-case
 * letters on-the-fly (as-you-type) to upper-case letters. And: Maybe it
 * could even be switched to @ref MultiSpinBox (but that would mean implement
 * support for hexadecimal digits in @ref MultiSpinBox).
 *
 * @todo Accept <tt>F5</tt> and <tt>Ctrl+R</tt> just with the same
 * functionality as the refresh button in the HCL @ref MultiSpinBox.
 * But attention: If a library user <em>embeds</em> the dialog, he does
 * not want his shortcuts to be intercepted!
 *
 * @todo It might be nice to support keyboard shortcuts for switching tabs
 * like in browsers, which is a concept many users might be familiar to.
 * Crtl+Tab to switch to the next tab in the list. Crtl+Shift+Tab to switch
 * to the previous tab in the list.
 *
 * @todo Start with dialog with Qt::yellow. You get HLC 100° 98% 95.
 * Push the apply button. Actual result: HLC 100° 98% 94 which has a slightly
 * different chroma value. Expected result: Ideally there would be no rounding
 * difference at all: Every once displayed value is always recognized as
 * valid. When the color space conversion takes place, we could (and should)
 * make this sure for HLC values. But then comes the also the rounding
 * in @ref MultiSpinBox. Is there any solution?
 *
 * @todo If there is no alpha widget <em>and</em> the actual layout is
 * expanded (either explicitly by @ref DialogLayoutDimensions::Expanded
 * or implicitly by @ref DialogLayoutDimensions::ScreenSizeDependent on
 * bigger screens) <em>than</em> it would make sense to move
 * the @ref ColorDialogPrivate::m_buttonBox into the same column as
 * the @ref ColorDialogPrivate::m_numericalWidget, namely <em>below</em>
 * the @ref ColorDialogPrivate::m_numericalWidget. This saves screen
 * space and does not confuse the user.
 *
 * @todo Provide an overloaded version of @ref open() that accepts
 * arguments for new-style connect statements, making use of compiler
 * checks.
 *
 * @todo Use the <em>actual</em> color profile of the monitor.
 *
 * @todo The LCh-hue (and so the graphical widgets) jumps forward and backward
 * when changing RGB-based values (also HSV) when entering and leaving the gray
 * axis, due to lack of hue information. Would it be an option to store the
 * old hue to get a meaningful hue?
 * Should it be only really for the gray axis, or allow a certain tolerance
 * around the gray axis is necessary to make this work well - and if so,
 * how much tolerance? Would it be useful to define a certain hue, for
 * example 0°, as default hue for when no old hue is available but the
 * new value is on the gray axis?
 *
 * @todo Custom layout management that has a specific height-per-width ratio
 * considering the @ref ChromaHueDiagram and and @ref WheelColorPicker
 * and <em>their</em> useful height-per-width ratio.
 *
 * @todo Support for other models like HSL (HSB is yet identical to HSV?),
 * Munsell? With an option to enable or disable them? (NCS not, because
 * it is not free…)
 *
 * @todo Would CMYK support make sense? Would it integrate intuitively into
 * the user interface? If we would have CMYK support, we would have two
 * different profiles (RGB and CMYK) active simultaniously. Which one is the
 * profile that defines the available color space? Would this be intuitive?
 * Also, when using two different profiles, it will be possible to have
 * out-of-gamut colors in one of the profiles. How to represent this in the
 * UI?
 *
 * @todo Provide palettes? Include there a palette with
 * QColorDialog’s standard colors as RGB values without
 * a specific color space, with the name “Default”? Add
 * <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#named-colors">CSS colors</a>
 * as defined as sRGB values?
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Web-safe_colors">
 * Web-safe colors</a> (but with another name, maybe “216 colors”)
 * as bigger palette, without a specific color space – does
 * not make sense, since we provide a perceptual color dialog,
 * which allows things much beyond 216 colors, and 216 colors
 * isn’t a useful standard anymore, and not a nice palette either.
 *
 * @todo Instead of (or additional to) palettes: Discrete widgets, that have
 * a fixed (quite limited) number of fields to chose for the user?
