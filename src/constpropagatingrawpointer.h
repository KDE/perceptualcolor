/** @internal
 *
 *  @brief A <tt>const</tt> propagating raw pointer
 *
 * With normal raw C++ pointers (and also with <tt>std::unique_ptr</tt>
 * pointers), within <tt>const</tt> functions you can do non-const
 * operations <em>on objects that a pointer points to</em>.
 *
 * <em>This</em> pointer type is different: It propagates the const-ness of
 * the object members and propagates them to the call through the pointer;
 * it will trigger a compiler error if non-cost access to object members
 * or methods is done from within const functions. Apart from that, it
 * behaves similar to raw pointers. For compatibility with raw pointers,
 * it also casts implicitly to the corresponding raw pointer (but only
 * within non-<tt>const</tt> contexts).
 *
 * Think of this template as a simple alternative to
 * <tt>std::experimental::propagate_const&lt; T* &gt;</tt>
 *
 * Example code:
 * @snippet testconstpropagatingrawpointer.cpp example
 *
 * @note Currently, this class does not implement assignment operators
 * or assignment constructors. Once constructed, an instance of
 * this class cannot be changed anymore.
 *
 * @note A @ref ConstPropagatingRawPointer pointer variable itself
 * may not be const! (Otherwise, this would make <tt>const</tt>
 * <em>all</em> access even to non-const functions of the pointed
 * object.)
 *
 * @sa @ref ConstPropagatingUniquePointer
 *
 * @note There exist very sophisticated implementations like
 * https://github.com/jbcoe/propagate_const but we use nevertheless
 * our own light-wise implementation because this seems to be enough
 * for our limited use case.
 *
 * @note This class could be replaced in the future by <tt>
 * <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/propagate_const">
 * std::experimental::propagate_const</a></tt> if this one ever becomes
 * part of the C++ standard. (Experimental features however are optional
 * for compilers, so not all of them implement them. Furthermore, they
 * can still change. Therefore, we cannot use experimental features here.) */
