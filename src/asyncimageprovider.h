/** @internal
 *
 * @brief Support for image caching and asynchronous rendering.
 *
 * This class template is intended for images whose calculation is expensive.
 * You need a (thread-safe) rendering function, and this class template will
 * provide automatically thread-support and image caching.
 *
 * @note This class template requires a running event loop.
 *
 * @tparam T The data type which will be used to parameterize
 * the image.
 *
 * @section asyncimageproviderfeatures Features
 *
 * - Asynchronous API: The image calculation is done in background
 *   thread(s). Results are communicated by means of the
 *   signal @ref interlacingPassCompleted as soon as they are available.
 * - Optional interlacing support: The rendering function can
 *   provide a low-quality image first, and then progressively
 *   better images until the final full-quality image. Since today’s
 *   high-DPI screens have more and more pixels (4K screens, perhaps
 *   one day 8K screens?), interlacing becomes increasingly important,
 *   especially with complex image calculation. The @ref InterlacingPass
 *   helper class makes it easy to implement  Adam7-like interlacing.
 * - Cache: As the image calculation might be expensive, resulting image is
 *   cached for further usage.
 *
 * @section asyncimagecreate How to create an object
 *
 * @snippet testasyncimageprovider.cpp How to create
 *
 * @section asyncimageuse How to use an object
 *
 * The cache can be accessed with @ref getCache(). Note that the
 * cache is <em>not</em> refreshed implicitly after changing the
 * @ref imageParameters(); therefore the cache can be out-of-date.
 * Use @ref refreshAsync() to request explicitly a refresh.
 *
 * @section asyncimagefurther Further reading
 *
 * @sa @ref AsyncImageRenderThread::pointerToRenderFunction.
 *
 * @note This class template is reentrant, but <em>not</em> thread-safe!
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * @section asyncimageinternals Internals
 *
 * @note <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/63021891">The <tt>Q_OBJECT</tt>
 * macro and templates cannot be combined.</a> Therefore,
 * @ref AsyncImageProviderBase serves as a base class to provide
 * signals for @ref AsyncImageProvider.
 *
 * @todo Possible (or even necessary?) improvement: When
 * a widget that uses this class becomes invisible (see
 * @ref AbstractDiagram::actualVisibilityToggledEvent for
 * details about the type of visibility we are talking about)
 * it might make sense to delete the cache once the image
 * parameters change. This might reduce memory consumption (though
 * in the moment of changing from one tab to another, anyway
 * both widgets on these tabs will need a cache). If this is <em>not</em>
 * implemented, @ref AbstractDiagram::actualVisibilityToggledEvent
 * can be removed.
 *
 * @todo Possible (or even necessary?) improvement: If a requested image
 * is yet either available or in computation at another object of the same
 * template class, that this object should not trigger a new computation,
 * but use the yet available/running one of the other object. In practice,
 * this might be interesting for the @ref ColorWheelImage, which is likely to
 * be used twice within the same @ref ColorDialog at exactly the same size.
 * This requires probably a thread-safe management of instances through
 * static class members, to make sure that the resulting objects are
 * (while still not thread-safe themselves) at least reentrant.
 *
 * @todo Possible (or even necessary?) improvement: Render an image
 * could be split to more than one thread (if actually the current computer
 * we are running on has more than one core) to speed up the rendering.
 *
 * @todo Possible (or even necessary?) improvement: For @ref ChromaHueDiagram
 * and @ref ChromaLightnessDiagram, the image cache is quite big, because
 * we cache both, the center of the diagram and also the surrounding
 * @ref ColorWheelImage. Could we combine both into one single cache? But
 * if so, wouldn’t this make problems with anti-aliasing if in future versions
 * we do not want to preserve a distance between the color wheel and the
 * inner content anymore? And: Would this be compatible with sharing
 * computations between various objects of the same template class to
 * safe computation power?
 *
 * @todo Possible (or even necessary?) improvement: Cancel the current
 * rendering (if any) when new image parameters are set.
 *
 * @todo Possible (or even necessary?) improvement: Do not cancel rendering
 * until the first (interlacing) result has been delivered to make sure that
 * slowly but continuously moving slider see at least sometimes updates… (and
 * it's more likely the current value is near to the last value than to the
 * old value still in the buffer before the user started moving the cursor
 * at all). The performance impact should be minimal when interlacing is
 * used. And if no interlacing is available (though we might even decide not
 * ever to do non-interlacing rendering), the impact should also not be
 * catastrophic either.
 *
 * @todo xxx Use this class for all image providers, and not only for
 * @ref ChromaHueImageParameters.
 *
 * @note It would be nice to merge @ref AsyncImageProviderBase and
 * @ref AsyncImageProvider into one single class (that is <em>not</em> a
 * template, but image parameters are now given in form of a QVariant).
 * It would take @ref AsyncImageRenderThread::pointerToRenderFunction as
 * argument in the constructor to be able to call the constructor of
 * @ref AsyncImageRenderThread.
 * <br/>
 * <b>Advantage:</b>
 * <br/>
 * → Only one class is compiled, instead of a whole bunch of template classes.
 *   The binary will therefore be smaller.
 * <br/>
 * <b>Disadvantage:</b>
 * <br/>
 * → In the future, maybe we could add support within the template for a
 *   per-class inter-object cache, so that if two objects of the same class
 *   have the same @ref imageParameters then the rendering is done only once
 *   and the result is shared between these two instances. This would
 *   obviously be impossible if there are no longer different classes
 *   for different type of images. Or it would at least require a special
 *   solution…
 * <br/>
 * → Calling @ref setImageParameters would be done with a <tt>QVariant</tt>
 *   (or an <tt>std::any</tt>?), so there would be no compile-time error
 *   anymore if the data type of the parameters is wrong – but is this
 *   really a big issue in practice?  */
